# hara.lang

Hara is a small, runtime-neutral language for live systems. The current supported language
implementation is the Truffle runtime: it provides a compact L0 core, persistent data, explicit
mutable `array`/`object` markers, protocols, promises, bytes, capability-gated I/O, and a JLine REPL.

## Repository layout

- [`java/`](java/) — the Java/Truffle runtime (Maven project, CLI, native-image).
- [`rust/`](rust/) — the Rust/embedding runtime: native CLI, wasm builds, web
  loader, and in-tree wasm extensions (`rust/extensions/`).
- [`lib/`](lib/) — hara-language source and workloads: the std foundation and
  Polis compiler port (`lib/src`, `lib/test`), demo projects
  ([`lib/examples/`](lib/examples/)), and benchmark suites
  ([`lib/bench/`](lib/bench/)).
- [`apps/`](apps/) — editor and browser apps:
  [`hara-chrome`](apps/hara-chrome/) (Chrome DevTools extension),
  [`hara-vscode`](apps/hara-vscode/), [`hara-emacs`](apps/hara-emacs/), and the
  planned [`hara-lsp`](apps/hara-lsp/) language server.
- [`docs/`](docs/) — documentation content (published via mkdocs).
- [`website/`](website/) — site infrastructure: mkdocs config, theme
  overrides, and the landing page.
- [`spec/`](spec/hara/) — normative language, runtime, and extension specs.
- [`books/`](books/) — planned book series (*The Little Book of HAL*).
- [`registry/`](registry/) — planned hara wasm extension registry.
- [`scripts/`](scripts/) — repo-level build/benchmark scripts.
- [`archive/`](archive/) — legacy material kept for history (old Clojure
  reference sources, one-off refactor scripts, C experiments, legacy docs).

## Quick start

Requirements: JDK 21 and Maven.

```shell
mvn -f java/pom.xml -Ptruffle package
./hara eval '(+ 19 23)'
./hara
```

The `hara` command starts the JLine REPL in the shared `ROOT` session and exposes that same
session through RESP on `127.0.0.1:1311`. Use `--offline` to start without the listener,
`headless` for a listener without terminal UI, and `remote HOST:PORT` for a client connection. The CLI also supports `run <file>`, `stdin`, and `help`. For a native-image build, see the
[developer guide](docs/development.md); native mode intentionally removes dynamic JVM services.

Per-component builds:

```shell
cargo test --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml          # Rust runtime
cd apps/hara-chrome && npm ci && npm run build      # Chrome extension
cd website && mkdocs build -f mkdocs.yml            # docs site
```

## Current runtime boundary

The language does not expose ambient JVM host interop. JVM reflection, compilation, mutable
classpath access, files, and sockets are explicit capabilities or provider services. This keeps the
core portable to future runtimes such as WASM hosts.

The old interpreter/Foundation/TCP architecture is retained as
[`archive/legacy-docs/README.legacy.md`](archive/legacy-docs/README.legacy.md) for historical
reference only; it is not the current language guide.

## Status

Hara is an active experimental runtime. The L0 slice and focused conformance suites are the source
of truth. Provider discovery and WASM execution are documented contracts with
implementation work still in progress.
